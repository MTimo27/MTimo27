### 👋 Hi, I’m Mihai

I’m a **Full Stack Software Engineer** focused on building reliable, production-ready systems.

I work across frontend and backend development and apply AI where it fits naturally, with an emphasis on automation, clean architecture, and pragmatic solutions that hold up in real-world use.

Currently combining my work with an **MSc in Artificial Intelligence**, and sharing practical projects and lessons from building AI in production.
